# Contributing To Nemo-Skills

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Nemo-Skills!

## Code Quality

- Follow the existing code style and conventions
- Write tests for new features
- Update documentation to reflect your changes
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting a PR
- Do not add arbitrary defaults for configs, be as explicit as possible.

### Setup

Install the dependencies, including development dependencies as,

```shell
pip install -e .[dev]
```

### Pre-Commit Hooks

We use [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/) to manage pre-commit hooks.
To install, run

```shell
pre-commit install
```

All subsequent commits will be checked according to configuration in [`.pre-commit-config.yaml`](./.pre-commit-config.yaml).

## Signing Your Work

* We require that all contributors "sign-off" on their commits. This certifies that the contribution is your original work, or you have rights to submit it under the same license, or a compatible license.

* Any contribution which contains commits that are not Signed-Off will not be accepted.

* To sign off on a commit you simply use the `--signoff` (or `-s`) option when committing your changes:
  ```bash
  $ git commit -s -m "Add cool feature."
  ```
  This will append the following to your commit message:
  ```
  Signed-off-by: Your Name <your@email.com>
  ```

## Running Tests
