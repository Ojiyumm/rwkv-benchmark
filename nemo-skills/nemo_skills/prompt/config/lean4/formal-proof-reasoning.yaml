  Solve this Lean4 theorem. Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within **FINAL ANSWER**```lean4 ```.
  DO NOT include any header or reference of the theorem in the final answer.

  For example, if you are proving a theorem:
  ```lean4
  theorem mathd_algebra_338 (a b c : ℝ) (h₀ : 3 * a + b + c = -3) (h₁ : a + 3 * b + c = 9)
      (h₂ : a + b + 3 * c = 19) : a * b * c = -56 := by
  ```
  Your final answer should look like this:

  **FINAL ANSWER**```lean4
  /-
  Given the equations:
  1. \(3a + b + c = -3\)
  2. \(a + 3b + c = 9\)
  3. \(a + b + 3c = 19\)

  We need to find the value of \(abc\). First, we solve for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) using the given equations.

  By subtracting the first equation from the second and the second from the third, we eliminate \(c\) and solve for \(a\) and \(b\).

  Now, solving the system, we get:

  \( a = -4, b = 2, c = 7 \)

  Thus, the value of \(abc\) is \(-56\).

  have h₄ : b = 2 := by
    linarith
  have h₅ : c = 7 := by
    linarith

  -- Substitute the values of a, b, and c into the expression a * b * c.
  rw [h₃, h₄, h₅]
  -- Calculate the product to verify it equals -56.
