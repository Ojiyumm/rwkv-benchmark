This gives us 2 options for each layer. Since there are 5 layers, the total number of possibilities is 2^5 = 32.\n\nNow, let's consider the decorative layer. The decorative layer must match the type of cake in the top layer. If the top layer is chocolate, the decorative layer can be nuts (N). If the top layer is vanilla, the decorative layer can be sprinkles (S).\n\nFor each of the 32 possible 5-layer cakes, there is only one possible decorative layer.
